# Machine Learning Algorithms

###### <i>"Google’s self-driving cars and robots get a lot of press, but the company’s real future is in machine learning, the technology that enables computers to get smarter and more personal"</i> - <b>Eric Schmidt (Google Chairman)</b>



# Description About this Repository

<p style="font-size: 18px;" align="justify">This repository is defined in two folder basically. The folder represents the subarea of machine learning that is <b>supervised learning</b>, and <b>unsupervised learning</b>.</p>

<p style="font-size:14px;"> Bellow, I describe the files of the each folder, in other wold the supervised and unsupervised learning algorithm's.</p> 

<p style="font-size:14px;"><b>Supervised Learning</b></p>

# The order for Prepare the Dataset's to Train and Evaluate

For all these techniques, the following order was maintained:

1. Collecting Data
2. Analysis Data
3. Data Wrabling
4. Test & Train
5. Accuracy Check
# 
<p aling="justify">This repository was created for shown some algorithms of machine learning. It's <b>important</b> you have a <b>High-Level</b> Python to understanding of various machine learning algorithms. These should be sufficient to get your hands dirty. </p>

#
# Code Environment
You need use **jupyter notebook** and **venv** for run all of implementations.
- jupyter notebook (_terminal_)
